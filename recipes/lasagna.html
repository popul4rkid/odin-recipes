            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, 
                tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. 
                Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 
                1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, 
                fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, 
                for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. 
                Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, 
                combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons 
                parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. 
                Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the 
                mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over m
                ozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. 
                Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. 
                Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. 
                Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.
